Polygenic risk scores use genetic data to quantify disease risk and thus 
provide clinicians and public health workers with additional risk factors to inform
preventive efforts with the goals of enhancing health, lengthening life, and 
reducing illness and disability.
Recent technology advances have enabled genotyping and phenotyping of hundreds of thousands of
individuals as biomedical scientists seek to identify the genetic underpinnings of 
complex diseases in studies called genome-wide association studies.
Genome-wide association studies estimate associations between SNPs, one at a time, and a 
complex disease. 
Polygenic risk scores leverage genome-wide SNP effects to quantify disease risk. While scientists have developed 
many statistical methods to calculate polygenic risk scores, current methods 
demonstrate only weak correlations with disease status.
