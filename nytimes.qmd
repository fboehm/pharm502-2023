The human genome sequencing project of the 1990s and early 2000s ushered in a 
scientific effort to identify genes that contribute to different diseases, including 
heart disease, lung cancer, and schizophrenia. Large-scale studies have enrolled 
millions of people around the world to work towards this goal. They voluntarily collect 
a tissue sample, such as a cheek swab, saliva collection, or blood draw, from each 
person in the study. The collected tissue sample contains human cells, and, from
those cells, scientists can isolate a person's DNA, the alphabet that provides
the recipe for each person's biology, including their eye color, height, and 
their tendency to get sick. 
Scientists use statistical association tests to identify genes that contribute to 
a person's chances of getting a disease like lung cancer. The statistical association
tests work by comparing the DNA profiles of people with lung cancer to the 
DNA profiles of people without lung cancer. Each difference in DNA profile between the two groups, 
 1) people with lung cancer and 2) people without lung cancer, points to a gene that contributes to 
lung cancer.
By looking across people's entire DNA profiles, scientists can identify many genes that 
influence lung cancer development. 
It's important to point out that, in nearly all cases, no single DNA profile dictates 
that a person will get lung cancer; however, a person's chance of getting lung cancer
increases if they have a DNA profile that matches those of people who already have lung cancer.
