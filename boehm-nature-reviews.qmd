## Abstract



## Introduction

The sequencing of the human genome in the early 2000s enabled studies
to advance understanding of the genetic basis of human diseases and complex traits.
Subsequent development of high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies enabled 
large-scale collection of genetic data from millions of individuals.
