## Key Points



## Abstract



## Introduction

Our genes influence many aspects of our health and biology. 
While all humans share more than 99% of their DNA, every human's DNA contains millions of differences that make it unique.
These differences not only give us varying heights and eye colors, but they also influence our risk of developing diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.
Recent technologies have made it possible to acquire genetic data for millions of people, and this data has been used to identify thousands of genetic differences that influence disease risks.
